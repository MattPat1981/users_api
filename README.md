toy program built to use cosine similarity between users and an api built to utilize it


### The goal of this is 

- to build a model that creates a similarity score between users
- to build a RESTful API that can be called using curl or PyCurl
- to build a storage of the transformed dataset in DynamoDB
- to build a model endpoint that will return the most similar users when a user_handle is entered
